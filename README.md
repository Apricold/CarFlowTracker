# CarFlowTracker
This side project features a Python script leveraging a popular convolutional architecture model to dynamically count and estimate car speeds in real-time from a live YouTube traffic camera feed. 
Subsequently, it updates a local database connected through an API and presents a user-friendly dashboard for comprehensive data visualization.

# Technologies
Throughout this project, I utilized essential libraries and tools such as NumPy, Pandas, Ultralytics, OpenCV (cv2), and PyDrive2 to ensure robust functionality and efficient implementation

# Demo
